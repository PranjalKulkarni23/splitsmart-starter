# SplitSmart — starter

The starter app for the **deepEntra Academy · Build & Ship It** course. It's a basic
expense-splitter (one group, a list of expenses, a running total). Over the course you'll
give it an **AI brain** (Hour 3) and a **real database with logins** (Hour 5), then polish
and ship it to your own domain (Hours 7–8).

This is the **"My Group"** app you see on the course slide — the basic version you deploy in
Hour 2, before you add the magic.

## Hour 2 — get it on your laptop & ship it

### 1. Fork this repo
Click **Fork** (top-right) → you get your own copy under your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone your fork and open it
Ask your AI assistant: *"Clone my fork and open it in VS Code."* Or, in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/splitsmart-starter.git
cd splitsmart-starter
```

### 3. Install the app's parts
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Run it
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open **http://localhost:3000** — SplitSmart is alive on your laptop. 🎉

### 5. Make one tiny change
Ask your AI: *"Change the title to 'Raj's SplitSmart' and keep the button deepEntra blue."*
Save → the browser updates instantly. Then snapshot it:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "My first change"
git push
```

### 6. Put it on the internet — Vercel 🚀

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/maheshbaxi/splitsmart-starter)

- Import your fork into **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/new)** (it finds your GitHub repo).
- Click **Deploy** → ~1 minute → you get a live `…vercel.app` link. Open it on your phone and
  text it to a friend.
- From now on, **every `git push` redeploys your live site automatically.**

> 🔒 **Keep your API keys private** — never paste them into a screenshot, a commit, or a shared
> doc. Secrets go in Vercel's **Environment Variables** (and in `.env.local` locally, which is
> git-ignored). See `.env.example`.

## AI expense splitting

Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env.local` for local development and in your deployment's
Environment Variables. The expense form sends its sentence to `/api/split`; the server
uses Gemini to return the total amount, number of people (including you), amount per
person, and a description. For example, “split with 2 friends” counts 3 people, while
“just me” counts 1.
